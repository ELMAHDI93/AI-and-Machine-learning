📘 Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview
This repository contains an exported Jupyter Notebook (in HTML format), showcasing work on machine learning concepts and code execution. It reflects a hands-on approach to data exploration, model training, and result interpretation using Python in a JupyterLab environment.

🧠 Key Features
📊 Interactive Code Cells: Executed code cells demonstrating step-by-step workflows.

🧾 Formatted Outputs: Includes visual outputs (e.g., plots, tables) embedded directly in the document.

💻 Clean UI: Styled using JupyterLab and CodeMirror themes for readability and clarity.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy / Pandas / scikit-learn (likely used)

HTML & JavaScript (require.js) for exporting and rendering

🔍 What You’ll See
Code execution results (predictions, charts, metrics)

Documentation of machine learning tasks (e.g., regression, classification)

Use of standard Python libraries for data science

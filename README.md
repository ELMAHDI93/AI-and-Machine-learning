## 🧩 Problem Statement

Apple iPhones are globally recognized, but customer satisfaction is key to remaining competitive. Analyzing thousands of reviews manually is infeasible—so this project uses **NLP and Machine Learning** to classify reviews into:

- ✅ Positive
- ➖ Neutral
- ❌ Negative

This analysis can help Apple:
- Identify pain points from negative reviews
- Understand customer satisfaction
- Improve future product releases

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use traditional ML models and a transformer model (DistilRoBERTa) to classify customer sentiments
- Preprocess, vectorize, balance, and analyze the review data
- Compare model performance with metrics and confusion matrices

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `nltk` for text preprocessing
- `scikit-learn` for ML models and metrics
- `imblearn` for oversampling via SMOTE
- `transformers` and `datasets` from HuggingFace
- `torch` for model training
